# setup

This will create a virtual environment and add Flask as its first dependency.

```Python
conda install pipenv

# create our project directory and move to it
mkdir cashman-flask-project && cd cashman-flask-project

# use pipenv to create a Python 3 (--three) virtualenv for our project
pipenv --three

# install flask a dependency on our project
pipenv install flask
```
